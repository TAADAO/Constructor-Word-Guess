# Constructor-Word-Guess

This is the command line interface version of a hangman game using constructors that we learned in class. The program itself consists of files pulled from various npm sources, and 3 Javascript files: one that contained a constructor for the letter (letter.js), one that contained the constructor for the word (word.js), and the file that ran the actual game itself (index.js)

The letter.js file was able to be created without much difficulty. The word.js was a little more challenging but some referencing to past material was able to help me get through it. The main challenge was creating the game itself, which took a good amount of time, but I learned a lot of neat shortcuts to help me through it and was finally (after many frustrating errors for silly things) able to get everything working. 

The game itself is a hangman style game using an array I created of all the countries in the Western Hemisphere. You have 10 guesses to guess the name of the country. If you guess correctly, the letter will show up to replace the blanks in the word. If you are incorrect, you will receive a notification and the number of guesses you have left. If you guess the word successfully, you will receive a message stating you win. If you fail to guess within the amount of guesses allowed, the answer will reveal itself. In each case, the game will start over and the next word will generate.
